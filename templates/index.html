    <p>On the internet and sometimes in the physical world I go by the name <code>lislis</code>.</p>
    <p>I earn a living as a full-stack developer with focus on frontend. This is probably why you're here.</p>
    <p>Besides wage-labour I also enjoy creative coding and making video games.</p>

    <p>Email is usually the best way to reach me, just holler at <code>mail at lislis dot de</code>.</p>
    <p>If you want to get into my cool book you should encrypt your email. <br>Here is my <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search={{ config.extra.keyid }}">public key</a>.</br> In all seriousness though, you should encrypt your email.</p>

    <p>Advocating open source software, decentralized infrastructure and encryption is something of a hobby, too.</p>
    <p>You can find my code on either <a href="{{ config.extra.github }}">GitHub</a> or <a href="{{ config.extra.gitlab }}">GitLab</a> and myself on decentralised social media such as <a href="{{ config.extra.diaspora}}">diaspora*</a> and <a href="{{ config.extra.mastodon }}">Mastodon</a>.</p>

    <p>I try to regularly write <a href="{{ get_taxonomy_url(kind="category", name="blog") }}">on my blog</a>. More or less successfully.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I create imcomplete video games at game jams or hackathons. You can browse <a href="{{ get_taxonomy_url(kind="category", name="game") }}">some of my games here</a>.</p>

  <div class="c">
    <p>I'm involved in or help out with a couple of projects. They're super cool, definitely check them out!</p>
