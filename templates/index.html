  <div class="a">
    <p>I'm a human living in lovely Berlin, Germany.</p>
    <p>I earn a living as a full-stack developer with focus on frontend. This is probably why you're here.</p>
    <p>Besides wage-labour I also enjoy creative coding and making video games.<br>
      Whenever possible I advocate FLOSS software, decentralized infrastructure and encryption. I also consider myself fairly political, just <abbr title="for your information">fyi<abbr>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="b">
    <p>Email is usually the best way to reach me, just holler at <code>mail at lislis dot de</code>.</p>
    <p>If you want to get into my cool book you should encrypt your email. <br>Here is my <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x53dcb8642d183a51">public key</a>.</br> In all seriousness though, you should encrypt your email.</p>
    <p>In case you don't know what email encryption is or how it works you might want to try out a <a href="https://www.cryptoparty.in/berlin">CryptoParty</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="d">
    <p>You can find my code on either <a href="#">GitHub</a> or <a href="#">GitLab</a> and myself on decentralised social media such as <a href="https://wk3.org/u/lis">diaspora*</a> and <a href="https://toot.cat/@lislis">Mastodon</a>.</p>
    <p>On the internet and sometimes in the physical world I go by the name <code>lislis</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="e">
    <p>There is <a href="{{ get_url(path="/blog") }}">a blog</a> where I sometimes write things down. Be aware it's not always about technical things.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="d">
    <p>I love creating hardly playable video games at game jams, hackathons and other occations.</p>
    <p>You can browse <a href="{{ get_url(path="/games") }}">some games on the games page</a>.</p>

  <div class="c">

  </div>

  <div class="e">
    <p>Some meetups and conferences even accept my talk proposals and let me speak in front of people.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of <a href="{{ get_url(path="/talks") }}">all my talks</a> for your enjoyment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="d">
    <p>I'm also a member of the feminist hackspace <a href="">Heart of Code</a>. If you're town come by, say hi, and have a beverage with us!</p>
