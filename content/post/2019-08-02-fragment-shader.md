I really like The Mighty Boosh and its wacky humor and I'm still fascinated that this kind of show exists. It is simply brilliant.

Also, I'm deeply fascinated by graphics programming and how math is responsible that we can see and use graphical interfaces.

This is sort of the premise to this talk, also, reading *The Nature of Code* and *The Book of Shaders* and wanting to create cool stuff (as usual).

Why Clojure(Script)? Because [Heart of Clojure](https://heartofclojure.eu) is a conference organized by friends of mine, so I had so submit something that fits the main theme, right?

ClojureScript also has some nice features around hot code reloading and a browser REPL which make interactive browser things waaay more interesting!

[Code for FigFrag]() my shader live editing environment prototype.

[Sketchnote by Joy Clark]()

Fun fact: before FigFrag came [shady Yard](), a bootstrapped ClojureScript environment. But I ditchhed it because I thought it was too similar to [editor.bookofshaders.org]().
