Sara vs coffee was created at a [Berlin Mini Jam](http://berlinminijam.de/).
I did the coding while the name giving Sara drew the pixel art.

It's inspired by her life as barista and being terribly addicted to coffee at that time.
It also pokes fun at tech hipsters (like ourselves) working at coffee shops and consuming coffee to be productive.
