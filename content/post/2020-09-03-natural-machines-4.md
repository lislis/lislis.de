## Cellular Automata


## Algorithmic Botany

Davide Prati!

Horizon Zero Dawn

Parallel Harun Farocki 2012

### Research

- Mandelbrot
- Lindenmayer
- Prusinkiewitz
- Barricelli
- Flake

Book: The algorithmic beauty of plants
algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf

### Phyllotaxis

- Common nature pattern (pinepple, cacti, sunflower seeds etc)


### Gentle intro cc

sin(time * frequency) * aplitude

### Recursion Tree

### L-Systems

Formal Language - axiom and rules

And Recursion

Alphabet  (eg A, B, F)
Axiom is the seed
and reproduction rules

#### Generation
Axiom A
Rules A -> AB, B -> A

0 - A
1 - AB
2 - ABA
3 - ABAAB

---

Alphabet: Lamp, Phone, Coffee
Axiom: Phone
Rules: Lamp -> Phone Coffee, Phone -> Lamp Coffee, Coffee -> Coffee Lamp

0 - Phone
1 - Lamp Coffee
2 - Phone Coffee Coffee Lamp
3 - Lamp Coffee Coffee Lamp Coffee Lamp Phone Coffee
4 - Phone Coffee Coffee Lamp Coffee Lamp Phone Coffee Coffee Lamp Phone Coffee Lamp Coffee Coffee Lamp

#### Convention

In algorithmic beauty of plants

F = print segment
+ = turn left
- = turn right
[ = remember this position
] = go back to the remembered position

also f in the book


### Parametrical L-Systems

Add parameters

### Stochastical L-Systems

Probabilities

### Context-sensitive L-systems
