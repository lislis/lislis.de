## ml5

https://ml5js.org

based on tensorflow and tensorflow.js

But accessible and includes models

https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/


### Neural network

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk

Layers

Normalized pixel values from black 0.0 to white 1.0

Input -> Perceptron

Activation


Where does the dataset come from? Who trained it? For what purpose?

Mobilenet -> Google


Feature Extractor -> replace last layer with our choice

also save and reuse the model

### Regression

Image regression: how much does an image fit into one of two buckets?
A probability score
