Created at Global Game Jam 2018.

The theme was **transmission**.

You play as ray of light and need to make use of your physical capabilities to transmit, absorb and reflect on surfaces to increase your score. I used a [Launchpad Mini](https://novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-mini) as controller, lighting up in one of three colors to change to one of the three states. Goes faster as the game progresses.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/lislis/tar).
