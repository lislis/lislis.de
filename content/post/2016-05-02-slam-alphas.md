[Slam Alphas](https://slamalphas.org) is an non-profit association for women poetry slam artists in the German speaking poetry slam scene.

I support them on the technical side of things, running a Wordpress blog with a theme I coded after an [art student](http://alexandratheiler.ch/)'s design and a Rails app that functions as a [directory and map](https://karte.slamalphas.org/karte/de) of women poetry slammers in the DACH region.

Development on the map app was started by the RailsGirls study group [RubyMonstas](http://rubymonstas.org/) but I've since taken over maintenance and further development. Any helping hands appreciated!
