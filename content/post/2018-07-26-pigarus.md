Game-ish installation around an old flying pig toy.

Pigarus (Ikarus in form of a pig) wants to fly to the sun, and who are you to not support his endeavor?

The installation featured a phone cable spun diagonally through a room with the lower end being the start where people could blow into a fan to start a motor that would make Pigarus fly to the higher end of the room where a sun (and an end switch) awaited him.
