Created for [Lisp Game Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2018).

Based on my experience cycling through Berlin and having really close encounter with a white van.
Dedicated to the road rage on Berlin's streets.

[Game on itch.io](https://lislis.itch.io/bicycle-beatem-up) and [code on GitHub](https://github.com/lislis/bicycle-beat-em-up).
