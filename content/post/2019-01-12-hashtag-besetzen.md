Made at the Berlin Mini Jam in Godot, using the two themes "RIOT!" and "Monochrome".

Based on the squatting of the Google Campus construction site in Berlin a few months earlier.

[Code on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lislis/hashtagbesetzen) and [game on itch](https://lislis.itch.io/hashtagbesetzen).
