A game based on a real event. We were in Madrid sitting outside a bar having beers, when an apple came flying down from a house and smashed on the ground right next to us with apple sauce splatter over our stuff.

'Manzana' means 'apple' in Spanish.

The photo used is a photo I took of the house with the bar after it happened.

Build with the Piston game engine in Rust.
