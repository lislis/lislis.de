I wrote Beyoncé Brawles for RustFest Zurich after watching the music video of Beyoncé's song Hold Up.
Stylistically her wavy, yellow dress and the smashing of cars with a baseball bat while smiling had a lasting impression on me. Also it's perfect for a game!

The name of the game is a pun on her last name, Knowles.

It's build with the 2d Rust game engine ggez.
