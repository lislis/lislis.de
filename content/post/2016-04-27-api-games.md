A quick showcase of some game-ish things I've build using obscure web APIs.

The first version happened at [Women Who Code Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Berlin-Germany/events/230113042/) in 2016 and an updated version in 2017 at [CodePenDay Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/CodePenDay/events/242031110/).

[Live slides from CodePenDay](https://lislis.de/talks/codependay-hh) and [code for the slides]("https://github.com/lislis/api-games).

Funny story: I demoed the game `cat meow` and never closed the tab running the game. For the rest of the talk, while presenting the rest of the slides form a different tab, you could hear the meowing in the background and the backstage volunteers lost their shit over that.
