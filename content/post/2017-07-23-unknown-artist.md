Created at [Slavic Game Jam 2017](https://itch.io/jam/slavic-game-jam-2017) in Warsaw.

I made less of a game and more of an interactive thingy called Unknown Artist where you control a pulsating square that changes width and height according to position and color according to buttons to a lovely upbeat tune.

Playable with keyboard but more fun with a gamepad!
