### How does photogrammetry work?

gprogramm reconstructs shape form 2d images

rule of thumb: 1/ 3 overlap of objects

no angular distortion

in interiors, look at the center of the room, moving around the center

with a decent computer, you can even use film!

(light) Reflections are hard, not able to fix automatically. fix reflextions in photoshop? or look at it artistically?


## Blender

emulate numpad

node wrangler addon

render > render image
