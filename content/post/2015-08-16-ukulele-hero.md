My attempt to write a Guitar Hero clone for Ukulele with the webAudio API.

I wrote Ukulele Hero because I was (am!) deeply fascinated with the possibilities of the webAudio API wanted to create something with it. I also played quite a lot of ukulele at that time.

Then I submitted a talk proposal for Reject.JS that got accepted and thus I had to make it a reality.

[Play it live](https://lislis.de/games/ukulele-hero/) and [here is the code for the game](https://github.com/lislis/ukulele-hero).

Given at [Reject.JS 2015](http://rejectjs.org/) in Berlin.

[Live slides](https://lislis.de/talks/ukulele-hero) and [code for slides](https://github.com/lislis/ukulele-hero-slides).

[There is also a post about the game](@/post/2015-08-16-ukulele-hero.md).
