I wrote Ukulele Hero because I was deeply fascinated with the possibilities of the webAudio API wanted to do something with it. I also played quite a lot of ukulele at that time.

I then submitted a talk proposal for [Reject.JS](./post/2015-09-24-ukulele-hero-talk.md) which got accepted and then I had to make it a reality.

[Play it live](https://lislis.de/games/ukulele-hero/) and [here is the code for the game](https://github.com/lislis/ukulele-hero).
