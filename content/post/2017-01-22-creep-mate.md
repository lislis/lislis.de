Created together with a friend at a 'Lady problems' hackathon.

Instead of solving women's problems in society with tech`</cynicism>`, we made a pokemon-style game about creeps harassing you on the street while you try to buy Mate.

Yes, Mate as in the carbonated, caffeinated, iced-tea like beverage popular in Berlin.

[Play it live](https://creep-mate.herokuapp.com/) or [look at code](https://github.com/lislis/creep-mate).
