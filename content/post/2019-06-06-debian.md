So I just got a used Thinkpad for a bargain price and also decided to finally give Debian a shot.

After first downloading an image without any desktop, I downloaded one with gnome preinstalled, which I know from Ubuntu.

It was soon clear during installation that the wifi didn't work. Bummer.
I plugged in an ethernet cable to finish installation and decided to make wifi work later after that was done.

Luckily, you're never the first one to have a problem (or very seldom), so all it takes is patience in online searching.

So, first of `sudo systemctl status networking.service` told me pretty much what it was telling this person  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/390307/startup-debian-9-error-failed-to-start-raise-network-interfaces
like literally that's what I got.
With the solution I could then also restart my networking service and it was working. Hurray~

But that's not all, I still missed the wifi in the networkmanager panel.

Well, thanks to this thread https://askubuntu.com/questions/1005167/wifi-not-working-on-thinkpad-t460#1005190 I found that needed to install `iwlwifi` installation guide here https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi

then do the modprobe thing outlined `sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi && sudo modprobe iwlwifi` and boom, wifi in the network manager panel!
