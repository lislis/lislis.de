Probably my longest running project as part of the  RailsGirls study group [the RubyCorns](https://rubycorns.club).

For some time several study groups in and around Berlin appeared but nobody really knew where they met, who the coaches were or what they worked on.

This is where RoRganize starts, where you can enter yourself and/or your study group and find more students or coaches or company offices to host you.

Basically everything I know about Rails development stems from working on this app.
