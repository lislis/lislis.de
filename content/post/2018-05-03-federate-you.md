Introduction to Activity Pub and Mastodon.

Initially given at the [Ruby user group Berlin](http://www.rug-b.de/events/may-meetup-2018-438) (aka rug-b) in May 2018 and later at [Up.front](http://up.front.ug/2018/05/08/meetup/) and at the Hosting for yourself and others (HFYAO) meetup.

For the HFYAO meetup Malte and I also worked on [an Activity Pub script](https://gitlab.com/lislis/activity-pub-script) to check out the multitude of things to know to post a simple message into the fediverse.

[Live slides](https://lislis.de/talks/mastodon-federation/) and [code for slides](https://github.com/lislis/talk-mastodon-federation).
