Game created at [Nordic Game Jam 2017](https://www.nordicgamejam.com/) in Copenhagen.

The name and setting are inspired by a [song of the same name by the band Snow Patrol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz7RCbXP6Rc) which I interpreted as a dysfunctional relationship.

In the game you have conversations with your partner and get sent to buy groceries and get scored based what you bought that should have or shouldn't have bought. The shopping is sort of a jump'n'run.

While I still like my initial idea of the game I'm super not satisfied with how it turned out. Maybe I should redo it in the future.

[Game on itch.io](https://lislis.itch.io/get-balsamic-vinegar) and [code of the game](https://github.com/lislis/get-balsamic-vinegar).
