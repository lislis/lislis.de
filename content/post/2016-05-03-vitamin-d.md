Made together with my girlfriend for [Spring 2016 Lisp Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/spring-2016-lisp-game-jam).

I has just gotten notice from my doctor that I have to take vitamin D supplements which is where the idea to this stems from.

The game itself was supposed to be sort of a slot machine game where every time you get three in a row you can choose to spend it outside to have fun (and get that vitamin D) or spend it inside working on your career (more money, less vitamin D).

[Game on itch.io](https://lislis.itch.io/vitamin-d) and [the code for the game](https://github.com/vsmart/vitamin-d).
