Game made for [Global Game Jam 2017](https://globalgamejam.org/), the theme was **Waves**.

In the game you play as a famous person on a break from work trying to run some errands.
Problem is that being close to regular people will decrease your fame and without fame no job!
Can you manage to finish your errands before your break time's up and still be famous enough for the job?
