I once read that a developer's blog only lists two kinds of posts: apologies for not blogging more often and announcing that they've re-written the blog with a different framework, library, engine.

<!-- more -->

Since this is the first post here, I can safely say that this post belongs to the latter category.

## Welcome!

It only took my about 5 years to finally make a new one and I'm glad it's done (for now).

It's a good old static website written with [Zola](#) (which is written in Rust) that just outputs HTML and CSS. Beautiful! It replaces the old site, which was literally one handwritten HTML and one CSS file. With all content categorized and tagged and written in Markdown, this will hopefully serve as  a nice knowledge base in the future.

It is both for me to document what I have done and am doing and for others to find stuff that I did at some point. I had quite a bit of scattered games, projects and other content to find and write down and categorize but I think I got it all together in one place now. Which is nice.
Aside from that I want to write down various other things I find and learn on the blog. Turns out I forget and lose too many ideas and great things at this point and I'm quite annoyed at myself for not starting to do this earlier.

The next step is mostly enhancing the entries that already exist. That means screenshots, screencaps or gifs of games and projects, but I don't think it will be necessary to backfill everything at the very beginning. I had to go live at some point. Maybe I'll do it for everything or I'll just do it from here on. We'll see.

Have fun on the site!
