About my attempt to write a Guitar Hero clone for Ukulele with the webAudio API.

Given at [Reject.JS 2015](http://rejectjs.org/) in Berlin.

[Live slides](https://lislis.de/talks/ukulele-hero) and [code for slides](https://github.com/lislis/ukulele-hero-slides).

[There is also a post about the game](./post/2015-08-16-ukulele-hero.md).
