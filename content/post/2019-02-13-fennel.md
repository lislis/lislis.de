I quick talk and thingy for the lightning talks edition of the Berlin Clojure Meetup.

I had heard of Fennel through the Lisp Game Jam and thought that interop with Lua and Love2d sounds super amazing.

Because of the name 'fennel' I got into researching fennel the plant and made a little quick click thing walking through the fun facts.

Enjoy!
