Made together with my girlfriend for [Ludum Dare #37](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/), the theme was **One Room**.

A point and click style game where you need to combine objects and actions to get the mermaid out of captivity.

The name is inspired by the chapter ['The Bonnie Situation'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idV4GQRflHM) in Pulp Fiction.
