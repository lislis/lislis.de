Game written in Processing with a custom, Arduino-based hardware controller with a water level sensor.

You go fishing for fish and when you get one they give you a compliment.

It's a play on the phrase 'fishing for compliments' that I probably had stuck in my head [from listening to Courtney Barnett in an almost obsessive manner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWbGTqRc1xs).
