I'm a Berlin based creative technologist, artist and researcher. On the internet you'll most likely find me as lislis.

I love interactive technology and playful interfaces. That's why I create video games, installations and other software that let humans have experiences that make them feel something (instead of consuming something). I also love tinkering with electronics and trying out new programming languages and tools.

Email is usually the best way to reach me, holler at mail[at]lislis[dot]de. If you want to get into my cool book you can encrypt your email. Here is my [gpg key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x53dcb8642d183a51).

I do take privacy and data autonomy seriously. Software should be FLOSS, infrastructure decentralized and all communication encrypted.
